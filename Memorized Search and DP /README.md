# 1.DP Problem
1. Count problem
	* How many ways from A to B
	* How many ways to generate K sum

2. Calculate the min and max value
	* Longest Consecutive Sequence

3. Find if it's possible
	* Can we find k sum which equals to a certain sum?

Use recursion will generete lots of duplicate calculation, for example.

# 2.How to solve DP problem
1. Define status
	* The last step
	* convert it to sub problem
2. State transfer function
3. Initial condition and corner case
4. Order of calcuation
