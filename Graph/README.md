```
[ [0,1], [0,6], [0,8], [1,4], [1,6], [1,9], [2,4], [2,6], [3,4], [3,5],
[3,8], [4,5], [4,9], [7,8], [7,9] ]
```
* Advantages 

  1. Good for dynammic adding
  2. Save space
  
* Disadvantages

  1. Not good for finding connection between i and j
  2. Not good for treversal

* Advantages : 

  Good for searching connections between two points O(n)

* Disadvantages :
